# testworkflow

Ignore this repo. Just testing.

This line is for v1.0.1, anotated.

I forgot to push v1.0.2 changes so v1.0.1 and 1.0.2 are the same.
The v1.0.2 won't appear in `git describe`.

And this is for v1.0.3 not anotated.

A change over v1.0.3.

We are in 

    $ git describe --tags
    v1.0.3-1-g1f80e6b



Let's say this is a placeholder for version:

Version: _GIT_VERSION_
